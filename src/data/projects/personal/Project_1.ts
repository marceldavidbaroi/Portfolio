  shortDescription: "A Quasar and Firebase-powered travel planning application.",
  longDescription:
    "WildPlan is a full-featured travel planning application built using Quasar (Vue.js framework) on the frontend, with Firebase providing authentication and Firestore as the real-time NoSQL database. Users can create trips (public or private), build and customize daily itineraries, manage packing lists categorized as personal or shared, assign roles and responsibilities to members, and manage trip tasks via a Kanban-style board. It includes a settings panel for user preferences such as theme switching, default visibility options, and saved contacts. Each trip includes its own settings form where roles, responsibilities, and permissions are defined. There's also a feature to store frequently used contacts (e.g., guides, drivers) with email addresses. Currently in progress: integrating an AI-powered assistant via Ollama to offer smart suggestions for trip planning, packing help, and automated itinerary generation.",
